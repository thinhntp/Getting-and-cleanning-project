### Getting and cleanning data
Folowing step by step below we'll get the tidy data stored in file which name's "**tidy_data.txt**" 
1. Download the data for project if it does not already exist in the working directory.
2. Load the activity and feature info.
3. Loads both the training and test datasets with names data_train and data_test, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation.
4. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset.
5. Merges the two datasets into dataset which name is data.
6. Converts the activity and subject of columns data into factors.
7. "melt" data so that each row is a unique subject-activity combination and store in melted_data.
8. Use cast funtion to creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair. The result stored in data which name is tidy_data.
9. Last step, we wrote the tidy_data into file name "tidy.txt".
### Summarizes the resulting data fields in "**tidy_data.txt**".
